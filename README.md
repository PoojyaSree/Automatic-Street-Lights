# Automatic-Street-Lights
->The main purpose of the project is to switch ON and OFF street lights without manual operation.
IR sensors take a major part in this project.
IR sensor is like our eye which detect the presence of an object.
In the present days automated systems have less manual operations ,high flexibility and accurate.
Our project is to control the switching of street lights automatically.

MATERIALS USED
->PHYSICAL COMPONENTS:
  Thermocol sheets,
  Black chart,
  White paper.
->ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS:
  Arduino board ,IR sensors ,breadboard ,LEDs, jumper wires.
 
 WORKING-
 As IR senses the vehicle ,the street lights associated w.r.t sensor will switch ON and OFF after certain time.

  
 Result-
 The street light corresponding to that IR will switch ON automatically when a vehicle passes.
